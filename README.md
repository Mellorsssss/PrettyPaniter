### Pretty Painter

PrettyPainter is a simple but feature-rich drawing software based on PyQt5(Qt is awesome!), which supports general drawing operationsã€‚

### What is this for?

I wrote PrettyPainter for multiple undergraduate courses(*CG*, *Design Patterns*), you could learn how to use PyQt5 write simple project and how to use design patterns in such systems.

### Build

- This project is developed under windows, but considering the compatibility of PyQt5, it should also run well on Linux
.
- install dependancy: pyqt5

- just run `python gui.py`

#### Features
- [x] draw, erase basic graphic items(e.g. circles, squres)
- [x] add text description of the graphics items
- [x] undo and redo the actions
- [x] diy interface
